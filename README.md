# blog_code

This repository has code used for the blog pages on mmeredith.net.

In the past, code was packaged into .ZIP files which could be downloaded, but a lot of the code currently in the .ZIP files and shown on the web page is woefully out of date and won't run.

The plan is to have code here on GitHub and to check it regularly.
